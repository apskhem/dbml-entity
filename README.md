## About the project

The project aims to use this language as the standard language for declaring schema without digging deep into ORM's entity configuration.

Benefits:
    - All the benefits of DBML itself.
    - Reduces learning curve of the used ORM in the project.
    - Portability.
    - Productivity.
    - More focused.

## The taste

Below is the example of transpiling DBML into SeaORM entity.

## Supported ORM Entities

We aim to support various types of ORM not only in Rust.
