# DBML Entity

#### Database Markup Language (DBML) transpiler for various types of ORM Entity.

## What is DBML?

DBML (Database Markup Language) is an open-source DSL language designed to define and document database schemas and structures. It is designed to be simple, consistent and highly-readable.

## About the project

The project aims to use this language as the standard language for declaring schema without digging deep into ORM's entity configuration.

Benefits:

- All the benefits of DBML itself.
- Reduces learning curve of the used ORM in the project.
- Portability.
- Productivity.
- More focused.

## The taste

Below is the example of transpiling DBML into SeaORM entity.

```dbml
Table user {
  id integer [pk]
  username varchar
  role varchar
}
```

```rust
//! DBML Entity. Generated by dbml-entity 0.1.0

pub mod user {
  use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

  #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel)]
  #[sea_orm(table_name = "user")]
  pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub username: String,
    pub role: String,
  }

  #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
  pub enum Relation {}

  impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
}
```

## Supported ORM Entities

We aim to support various types of ORM not only in Rust.
